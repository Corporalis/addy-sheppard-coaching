title: What can coaching do for me?
---
Could you name the last time someone truly listened to you? Gave you time to think so you could articulate your thoughts? With everyone working to a busy schedule we are rarely given time to reflect on what we need and what we want.

We think nothing of spending money on home improvements, presents for other people etc. Why not invest in one of the most important things in your life, you?

How would your personal and work life be different if you:

* Were less afraid
* Were more confident
* Stopped people pleasing
* Believed in yourself
* Set boundaries
* Set goals and achieved them
* Set boundaries
* Had a plan

How would you answer the following questions?

* What goals/dreams/aspirations do I have that I'm not working on?
* What’s stopping me from making the changes that would improve your life?
* Are these goals truly in my heart or do I believe I ‘should’ be working on them?

All these ideas and more that can be explored through coaching to create that nudge you need to move forwards.
