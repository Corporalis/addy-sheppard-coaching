# What is coaching?

What exactly is coaching and how do I know it’s going to work for me?
This type of coaching is different from the ‘stop and give me 20’ style coaching you may have seen in films. It’s in essence; talking, thinking and listening.

If you really thought about it honestly could you name the last time someone truly listened to you? Gave you time to think and articulate your thoughts? With everyone working to a busy schedule it can almost feel like we’re rarely given time to do this.

If there are things in your work, business or personal life that you want to change what’s stopping you from doing so? What goals have you got that you aren’t working on? Are these goals truly in your heart or do you think you ‘should’ be working on them? 

These are all ideas that can be explored with a coach and more.

As you may have already gathered coaching can be a difficult concept to describe. In my opinion it’s something that needs to be experienced to be fully understood.
