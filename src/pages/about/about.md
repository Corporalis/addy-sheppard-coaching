Ever since I can remember I’ve always been fascinated by people. Thinking about why they do what they do. Why they don’t do what they say they want to. Why their goals are rarely achieved. What keeps them procrastinating?

I myself in the past could be described as a serial procrastinator. I was always finding reasons not to do something.  It wasn’t until I started looking at the reasons why I wasn’t achieving any of my goals that I truly understood what was stopping me. For me behind my lack of motivation stood a lot of fear, fear of failure, fear of comparison. Some of my goals that I thought I should be working towards turned out to be social pressures that I had put on myself. They were not my goals, they were someone else’s. It’s only when I started to unpick all of these thoughts that I could move on, which I did through the wonderful medium of coaching. 

I work as a coach in health and wellbeing sector and previously the employment sector. I’m a qualified Business and Personal Coach and ICF (International Coach Federation) certified. I trained with the highly esteemed Barefoot Coaching and have a post graduate certificate from Chester University. I have worked with an array of people (business leaders, musicians etc.) from all walks of life

One of my professional and personal goals is to help people set free their thoughts that are holding them back and work towards a positive plan for the future.
