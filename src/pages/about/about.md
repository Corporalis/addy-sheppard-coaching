Ever since I can remember I’ve always been fascinated by people. Thinking about why they do what they do. Why they don’t do what they say they want to. Why their goals are rarely achieved. What keeps them procrastinating?

In the past I could be described as a serial procrastinator. I was always finding excuses and distractions. This was incredibly frustrating, not only for me but for the people around me who could see that I was unhappy. I never articulated what I really wanted and often used to engage in tedious small talk to cover up talking about anything real. It wasn’t until I started looking at the reasons why I wasn’t achieving any of my goals that I truly understood what was stopping me. Behind my lack of motivation stood a lot of fear, fear of failure, fear of comparison. The goals I thought I should be working on turned out to be social pressures that I had put on myself. They were not my goals, they were someone else’s. It’s only when I started to unpick these thoughts that I could move on, which I did through the wonderful medium of coaching. From then on, I decided to **\#stopthesmalltalk**, open up, and start setting myself meaningful goals.

I work as a coach in the health and wellbeing sector and previously the employment sector. I’m a qualified Business and Personal Coach. I trained with the highly esteemed Barefoot Coaching. I have worked with an array of people from all walks of life, business leaders, musicians, small business owners to name a few.

One of my professional and personal goals is to help people set free their thoughts that are holding them back and work towards a positive plan for the future, and of course, **\#stopthesmalltalk**
