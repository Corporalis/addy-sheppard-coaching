I qualified as a Business and Personal coach with the esteemed Barefoot coaching after being inspired by my transformational sessions with my own coach. I've worked with people from all walks of life; business leaders, musicians and small business owners to name a few. I use a range of tools and techniques including using evidence based behavioural science in my work with Public Health. I have previously coached in the employment and charity sectors. The reason that I work with such a diverse array of people is that I believe coaching should be for everybody, not just an elite few.

Ever since I can remember, I’ve always been fascinated by human behaviour. Thinking endlessly about why people do what they do and what stops them from achieving their goals. I love empowering people to overcome their insecurities to achieve their dreams. This curiosity and desire lead me to start training as a psychotherapist, become a qualified coach and a mental health first aider. 

In the past I could be described as a serial procrastinator. I was always finding excuses and distractions. This was incredibly frustrating, not only for me but for the people around me who could see that I was unhappy. I never articulated what I really wanted and often used to engage in tedious small talk to cover up talking about anything real. It wasn’t until I started looking at the reasons why I wasn’t getting the results I wanted that I truly understood what was stopping me. Behind my lack of motivation stood a lot of fear, fear of failure and fear of comparison. The goals I thought I should be working on turned out to be social pressures that I had put on myself. They were not my goals, they were someone else’s. It’s only when I started to unpick these thoughts that I could move on, which I did through the wonderful medium of coaching. From then on, I decided to **\#stopthesmalltalk**, open up, and start living a life that I enjoyed.

One of my professional and personal goals is to help people set free their thoughts that are holding them back and work towards a positive plan for the future, and of course, **\#stopthesmalltalk**
