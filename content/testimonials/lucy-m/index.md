Working with Addy these last few months has been brilliant. I always feel incredibly positive after each session.
She has greatly helped me to be more thoughtful and understanding of what I want to do and how to get there.
Addy does this by giving me the tools to reach this point myself, through reflection and discussion. These
sessions have made me realise my potential and make great leaps forward in my career journey but also in
feeling more positive about my personal development.

I would highly recommend Addy as a coach, she creates a safe and calming environment to develop thoughts
and ideas that have allowed me to make positive changes in the way I think about myself and also in reaching
my goals.
